## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Accessing Connection Information

![Connection](/images/news/09-19-connection-info/connection.png "Connection")

- **Overview:** Users can view detailed information about system connections, such as wormholes or stargates, to track the ships that have passed through.
- **How to Open Connection Info:**
  1. On the map, locate a connection line between two systems.
  2. Click on the connection to open the information panel.
  3. The panel will display key data about the connection, including ships passed, time and estimated mass.

### 2. Viewing Ships Passed

- **Tracked Characters Only:** The information provided about ships that passed through a connection is based on characters being tracked via the map's character tracking system.
- **Details Provided:**
  1. Once the connection info is open, you will see a list of all ships that passed through the connection.
  2. The ships are displayed along with the names of the tracked characters that piloted them.
  3. This information allows you to track traffic patterns and analyze ship movements through the connection.

### 3. Viewing Estimated Ship Mass

- **Ship Mass Calculation:** The approximate sum of the mass of all ships that passed through the connection is also displayed.
- **How the Mass is Calculated:**
  1. Ship mass is estimated based on the ship type only.
  2. The displayed mass may not be 100% precise, as factors like ship fittings or enabled propulsion modes can influence the actual mass.
  3. The total mass of all ships that passed through the connection is provided to help estimate how much mass the connection has handled, which is particularly important for wormhole stability.

### Important Notes

- **Accuracy of Values:** Please note that all values (such as ship mass and the number of ships) are approximations. Ship mass is calculated based on known ship types, but the actual mass may vary depending on fittings and propulsion mode settings.
- **Tracked Characters Only:** The ships counted in the "Ships Passed" section are only those of characters being tracked by the map. Ships from non-tracked characters or unidentified sources will not be listed.

### Example Workflow

1. **Check Connection Info:**
   - Click on a connection between two systems (e.g., a wormhole connection).
   - Review the list of ships passed through the connection.

2. **Monitor Ship Mass:**
   - In the same panel, review the approximate total mass of the ships that have passed.
   - Use this information to assess the connection's usage or potential collapse (in the case of wormholes).

## Conclusion

The connection information feature is a valuable tool for tracking ship traffic and estimating mass through system connections. While the values are approximations, this feature provides useful insights for map users to monitor and manage connections more effectively. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact our support team.
