## How the Characters Limit Works

We track **every character (user) who has the map open in their browser** once they are logged in. The moment a user opens the map page, that character is considered **actively tracked**. When the user closes the map page, **tracking stops** for that character in about 5-10 minutes. 

- **Example:** If your subscription plan allows for 25 characters and you already have 25 users actively viewing the map, a 26th user will not be able be tracked until the 25th user closes the map page.  

This ensures you always have an accurate snapshot of who is viewing the map in real-time.

## How Subscriptions Works

1. **Choose Your Plan**  
   Select the plan that best suits your organization’s size and needs. You can upgrade or cancel at any time.
2. **Manage Your Balance**  
   You can top up your account using in-game ISK via our secure in-app interface. Map balances are used to pay for subscriptions.
3. **Automatic or Manual Renewal**  
   - can be set to auto-renew for uninterrupted service.
4. **Scale as You Grow**  
   If you find yourself needing more character slots or hubs, upgrade from Alpha to Omega & select limits that suit your needs.

## Why Subscribe?

- **Enhanced Collaboration:** More characters can join your map, facilitating broader intelligence sharing and planning.
- **Having less limits:** Keep track of more routes, system comments, map audit events, and more.
- **Map API & External Apps support:** Connect your tools or bots to the map, get real-time updates, and more.

## Conclusion

Our subscription models are designed to cater to both small and large groups, with flexible options to match your operational needs. Whether you’re a small corp just starting out, or a massive alliance conducting large-scale operations, our app’s shared mapping tools will help you navigate New Eden more effectively.
