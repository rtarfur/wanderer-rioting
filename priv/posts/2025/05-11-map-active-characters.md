![Map Icon](/images/news/2025/05-11-map-active-characters/map.png "Map Icon")

This page displays **only currently active characters** â€” those who have the map page open in an active browser tab or window.

### Key Use Cases:
- Identify active pilots on your map
- Monitor user activity and access level
- Manage tracked status to stay within subscription limits

## ðŸ‘¤ Character Grouping by User

Each user may have multiple EVE Online characters authorized. On this page:
- Characters are **grouped under their owning user**
- Admins can easily see which characters belong to the same person
- Useful for distinguishing between multiboxers or corp mates sharing access

## ðŸ”§ Admin Actions

Map **owners and administrators** can:

- âœ… **See viewer-only access**: Identify characters who can view but are not being tracked.
- ðŸš« **Force Untrack** characters:
  - Stop tracking & remove characters from map.
  - Useful to stay within your character limit or reset tracking manually.
  - Note: The user should re-enable tracking later if needed manually in map tracking settings.

## ðŸ›‘ Notes & Recommendations

- A character is **counted toward the Characters Limit** of the map's subscription **only when tracked**.
- Tracking begins **as soon as the character opens the map page** in any tab/browser.
- Closing all tabs with the map **automatically stops tracking** for that character (after a small period about 15 minutes).
- This system ensures you always have a live (tracking data automatically updated every 30 seconds), accurate picture of map usage across your team.

By using the **Map Active Characters** page, admins can efficiently manage map activity, maintain security, and optimize performance across their team or alliance.
