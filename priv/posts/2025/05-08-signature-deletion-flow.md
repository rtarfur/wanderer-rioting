### Introduction

Managing cosmic signatures is a core part of mapping and navigation in EVE Online. With our latest update, signature deletion is now **instant, real-time, and reversible**—making it easier than ever to keep your map up to date and error-free.

This guide covers the new signature deletion flow, how to use the undo feature, and what happens behind the scenes to keep your map clean and synchronized for all users.

---

### 1. The New User Flow: Instant, Real-Time, Reversible

- **Delete a signature:** When you remove a signature, it disappears from your map (and all other users' maps) instantly after a server roundtrip.
- **Undo:** If you make a mistake, you have a window of up to 30s to undo the deletion

### 2. How to Use the New Signature Deletion Flow

1. **Select and Delete:**
   - Open the system signatures widget.
   - Select one or more signatures and click delete (or paste and use lazy delete).
   - The signatures will disappear for all users viewing the same system.

2. **Undo a Deletion:**
   - After deleting, an **Undo** button appears for you (the user who deleted the signature) and remains visible based on your timeout settings.
   - Click **Undo** to restore the removed signatures instantly for all users.
   - If you don't click Undo in time, the deletion becomes permanent

3. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - All users see signature changes (add, update, remove, undo) in real time—no need to refresh.

### 4. FAQ & Troubleshooting


**Q: Who sees the Undo button?**
- Only the user who deleted the signature sees the Undo button

**Q: Do all users see the same signature list in real time?**

- The new flow is optimized for real-time collaboration and efficient cleanup, ensuring your map stays fast and accurate.
